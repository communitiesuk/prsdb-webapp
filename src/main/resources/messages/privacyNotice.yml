    paragraph:
      one: >-
        Please be aware that the PRS Database private beta is a temporary initiative designed to test and evaluate the
        functionality of the future PRS Database service.
      two: >-
        Your personal data will be securely deleted no more than a month after the conclusion of this private beta. 
        This means that you will need to re-register for the mandatory service (and if participating in future private
        betas).
  four:
    heading: 4. With whom we will be sharing the data
    paragraph:
      one: >-
        This data will be made available to the following councils: Fenland, Birmingham, Leeds, Plymouth, Oxford,
        Ealing, Nottingham, Manchester, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Gateshead local councils. The local councils will
        only use the data to test the functionality of the PRS Database.
      one.heading: '4.1 Controller:'
      three: >-
        We are employing an external organisation to provide service desk support functionality during the private beta
        on behalf of MHCLG. We have a Data Processing Agreement in place to ensure that the data is processed securely
        and in accordance with all relevant data protection law. The processing will involve using your personal details
        to assist with your enquiries.
      three.heading: '4.2 Processor:'
      two: >-
        Please remember that there isn’t currently a duty for landlords to register to the PRS Database, meaning that
        this data will not be used by councils for enforcement of future duties relating to the PRS Database (such as
        the duty to keep information up to date). Similarly, local councils have been told not to use the information
        you provide on this private beta for enforcement purposes.

    heading: 9. Storage, security and data management
    paragraph:

        measures in place to protect it from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.

    paragraph:
      five: >-
        During the private beta, you can choose to de-register property(s) and/or yourself from the service at any
        point. This would completely delete that particular property record / your entire landlord record from the PRS
        Database.
      four: >-
        To help us effectively test the database’s functionality in real-world scenarios, including how local councils
        might interact with the data to identify and support compliance, we kindly ask that you provide accurate and
        up-to-date information when you register and manage your property details. Engaging with the service in this
        way, as you will when it becomes mandatory, is crucial for the success of this private beta.
      one: >-
        The following is to explain your rights as a private landlord under this Private Rented Sector Database (PRS

          To meet the obligations in the Renters’ Rights Bill, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
          (MHCLG) is required to develop and maintain the PRS Database, which allows for the collection of information
          from private landlords in the private rented sector. MHCLG is the Data Controller as described in the General
          Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). Our Data Protection Officer can
          be contacted at

      one: >-
        Your personal data (your name, date of birth, landlord address, email address, phone number, landlord
        registration number and usage data) collected will be processed within the UK. During the private beta, we are
        not sending personal data overseas. We do have default in-region Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service
        (AWS RDS) copies that will be manually deleted as part of deleting the database records at the end of the
        private beta. MHCLG will ensure that this complies with data protection law and that appropriate safeguards are
        in place to protect your personal data.

    paragraph:
      four: >-
        Ethnicity is classed as “special category data” under data protection law. We request this in the feedback
        survey (on an optional basis) so we can check whether our service works well for people from different
        backgrounds. Our lawful basis for collecting it is:
      four.bullet.one: >-
        <strong>Article 9(2)(g) UK GDPR</strong> – processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest 
        (developing an accessible government service).  This is supported by Schedule 1, Part 2, paragraph 8 of the Data
        Protection Act 2018 (equality of opportunity or treatment).

        In addition to the above, we will be relying on your consent under Article 6(1)(a) of the UK GDPR for usage data
        we will collect for service improvement through Google Analytics 4. We will obtain your consent via a cookie
        banner when you first access the service, allowing you to choose whether to enable the collection of this type
        of usage data. You can withdraw your consent at any time via the cookie settings on the PRS Database website.
      two: 'For MHCLG, the lawful basis that applies to this processing is:'

        the exercise of official authority (developing an accessible government service).
