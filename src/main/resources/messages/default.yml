          initiative designed to test and evaluate the functionality of
          the future PRS Database service.
        two: Your personal data will be securely deleted no more than a month
          after the conclusion of this private beta.  This means that you
          will need to re-register for the mandatory service (and if participating
          in future private betas).
    four:
      heading: 4. With whom we will be sharing the data
      paragraph:
        one: 'This data will be made available to the following councils:
                    Fenland, Birmingham, Leeds, Plymouth, Oxford, Ealing, Nottingham,
                    Manchester, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Gateshead local councils.

        three: We are employing an external organisation to provide service
          desk support functionality during the private beta on behalf of
          MHCLG. We have a Data Processing Agreement in place to ensure
          that the data is processed securely and in accordance with all
          relevant data protection law. The processing will involve using
          your personal details to assist with your enquiries.
        three.heading: '4.2 Processor:'
        two: Please remember that there isn’t currently a duty for landlords
          to register to the PRS Database, meaning that this data will not
          be used by councils for enforcement of future duties relating
          to the PRS Database (such as the duty to keep information up to
          date). Similarly, local councils have been told not to use the
          information you provide on this private beta for enforcement purposes.

    one:
      paragraph:
        five: During the private beta, you can choose to de-register property(s)
          and/or yourself from the service at any point. This would completely
          delete that particular property record / your entire landlord
          record from the PRS Database.
        four: To help us effectively test the database’s functionality in
          real-world scenarios, including how local councils might interact
          with the data to identify and support compliance, we kindly ask
          that you provide accurate and up-to-date information when you
          register and manage your property details. Engaging with the service
          in this way, as you will when it becomes mandatory, is crucial
          for the success of this private beta.

          of deleting the database records at the end of the private beta.
