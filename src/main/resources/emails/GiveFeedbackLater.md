# Give feedback on the Private Rented Sector (PRS) Database so far

Tell us about your experience using the PRS Database so far.

We’d like to know how easy or difficult you found it to:
* register as a landlord
* register a property
* add compliance information

This feedback will help us understand what’s working well and what we need to improve.

The survey should only take a few minutes to complete.
