## What happens next
You'll be asked for your work details like your name and work email address.

Once you've registered you can view:
* property records
* landlord records
* reports from the public about the database

You can only view these records that fall within your local authority area ((name of council)).

It's a legal requirement for landlords and letting agents to register on the database, so you can get a better picture of housing in your local authority area.

## Before you register
You must sign up using a GOV.UK One Login linked to this email address.
