# Journey Framework

The Journey Framework is designed to make creating complex multi-page form journeys quick and easy without compromising on flexibility.

## Overview

The framework aims to:
- Commonise behaviours of multi-page form journeys without making it difficult to implement custom requirements
- Allow pages and groups of pages to be reused across different journeys
- Separate the structure of journeys from the content to make both easier to maintain and update
